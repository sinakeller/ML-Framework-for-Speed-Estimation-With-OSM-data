ML-Framework-for-Speed-Estimation-With-OSM-data
===============================================

This repository consists of a machine learning framework which can be applied to estimate the average speed of road segments in rural regions based on OpenStreetMap road network data. The detailed description of the methodology is given in the journal paper "Machine Learning Framework for the Estimation of Average Speed in Road Networks with OpenStreetMap Data" which is currently in review. 

Note that the applied target values in this repository differ from the true average speed values due to copyright reasons. The reference values in this repository are generated with the `Fuzzy-Framework <https://github.com/johannaguth/Fuzzy-Framework-for-Speed-Estimation#fuzzy-framework-for-speed-estimation>`_.
